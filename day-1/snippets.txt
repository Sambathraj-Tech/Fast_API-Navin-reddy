## STEP 5: Understand HTTP Before Coding

Before touching FastAPI, read this carefully. This is the "why" behind everything.
```
THE INTERNET IS JUST REQUESTS AND RESPONSES.

You (Browser/App)          Server (FastAPI)
      |                          |
      |-------- REQUEST -------->|
      |   "GET /users"           |
      |   "I want all users"     |
      |                          |
      |<------- RESPONSE --------|
      |   200 OK                 |
      |   [{"name": "Rahul"}]    |

**✅ What does GET mean in HTTP?**

    GET = request data from server
    It is used when you want to:
        👉 read information
        👉 fetch data
        👉 not change anything

**✅ What does @app.get("/") do?**

    - It creates a route (endpoint).
    - Decorator = route mapping.

**✅ Difference: path params vs query params**

    Path parameter:
        Part of the URL path.
        @app.get("/square/{number}")

    Query parameter:
        def multiply(x: int, y: int)
